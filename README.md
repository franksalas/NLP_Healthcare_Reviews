# TEXT CLASSIFICATION ON PUBLIC UNSTRUCTURED HEALTHCARE DATA 


Natural Language Processing or (NLP) is an area of AI that deals with the interactions between computers and natural human languages. 
Because of the regulations of HIPPA, most health data is private, but there is a vast amount of unstructured public health data in the form of online healthcare reviews. 
Crowd-sourcing specialized sites like RateMds, ZocDoc, Vitals or third party sited like Facebook or Yelp have a vast amount of data in the form of online reviews.  
A question arises with this kind of data, can public unregulated healthcare data improve patient care?   
I believe that health care providers can improve patient care by analyzing unstructured public healthcare data like online reviews by understanding patientsâ€™ needs in their own words using text classification to extract meaning.

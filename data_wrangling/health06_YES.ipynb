       "\"My husband and I see Dr. Chisholm and he's fantastic. Knowledgeable, quick witted, respects our intelligence and respects our wishes/opinions but tempers my first time mom anxieties professionally and swiftly. We definitely feel like we are in great hands. The nurses are all amazing, the ultrasound techs are wonderful, and the front desk staff has been great to us too. We really love this office. I will say that sometimes there is a very long wait on hold when you call the front desk for non-emergency assistance, but I know they have a lot of patients. I'm excited to continue my happy and healthy pregnancy, and deliver with Dr. Chisholm in the autumn.\""

# Proposal for Capstone Project

**Title**:Text Classification on Public Unstructured Healthcare Data


## Problem
Improving patient care has become a priority for all healthcare providers with the overall objective of achieving a high degree of patient satisfaction.
The HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) is a survey to measure patients' perspectives of hospital care.
While it is a great way to understand patients degree of satisfaction,  hospitals are not the only healthcare facilities where medical professionals provide care. 

Urgent care facilities, Mental health centers, Dialysis Centers
are but a small example of healthcare providers that are in need of some sort of a patient survey.
Social networks ( Twitter, Facebook) are a great tool to extract data related to health care providers, but Yelp seems a better choice.
Yelp is a local-search service powered by crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, including healthcare providers.
 I propose the use of Natural Language processing using the data from Yelp to analyze and understand healthcare-related businesses.


## Client  
Healthcare providers that want to explore with external data.

## Data
 The [yelp dataset ](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge) is an all-purpose dataset for learning. Its a subset of businesses, reviews, and user data of around 188 K business and 5.9 million reviews. 
 
I will extract healthcare related businesses star value and text reviews from the dataset and perform Natural language processing (NLP) to understand peoples experience of the healthcare business.
 

## Approach

I will first perform supervised learning with two classification algorithms Naive Bayes, vs SVC and evaluating its score.


## Limitations
 It will only include healthcare facilities that users review.

## Deliverables

1. Jupyter notebooks for 
    - data acquisition
    - data cleaning
    - data exploration analysis
    - machine learning model development.

2. Report on the capstone project
3. Presentation of the capstone project.

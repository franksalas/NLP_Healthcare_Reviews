## NAÏVE BAYES Naïve Bayes 
classifier is a good way to start since its very simple to implement; it lets you identify form a text source whether this label is more likely than that label, It’s called naïve because it ignores word order and looks at the word frequency. 

## SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
In SVM each data item as a point in n-feature space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. We perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes. What we are trying to do is maximize our margin, that is the distance between hyper-plane and the nearest points.
